Coding Quiz Redo is a new project that I have decided
to create as an opportunity to both refresh my JS
skills as well as use newly learned JQuery options. 
After having to take some time off from coding to 
work and run my business, I am choosing to redo 
this project that I created (with help) during my
coding bootcamp experience. I created an additional
coding quiz project a while back and though I was
quite satisfied with working my way through much
of the project, I did not finish the project and
chose to start my Rock Paper Scissors app instead. 
Having completed my Rock Paper Scissors app using 
OOP and JS, I have decided to return to this project, 
start fresh, and incorporate JQuery into this app. 

I believe that I am at the point where I should be 
attempting to further my knowledge about front end
libraries and frameworks for javaScript. For this
project I will be trying to incorporate JQuery to 
hopefully reduce the total amount of code while 
learning more about this JS library. I think this 
project offers a number of solid opportunities to 
both refresh my knowledge working with JS while 
allowing the opportunity to perhaps try different
approaches to completing the project.
